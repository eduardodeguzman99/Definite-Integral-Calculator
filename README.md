# Numerical Analysis - Integral Calculator
The primary goal of this project is to write R code that will implement algorithms to will approximate definite integrals.
Specifically, we look at the Improved Trapezoid Rule, and the General Simpsonâ€™s Rule for numerical integration.
For simplicity, I have included all of the functions that I used in a single file, Functions.R. 
You can think of this as importing a library into your programs, as you will need to run this script in its entirety in order to use the methods described below.
Afterwards, you should be able to run these functions directly in the console, or as an R function in another script.
